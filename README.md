# Trading Bot Platform

## Project Overview
A full-stack, milestone-driven trading platform for automated crypto/stock/forex trading. Built with Node.js/Express/MongoDB (backend) and React/Redux/Tailwind (frontend). Features include user management, subscription/payments, bot automation, backtesting, and more.

---

## 1. Workflow & Milestones

- **Agile, milestone-driven development**: Each major feature is a milestone, with regular demos and feedback.
- **Backend-first for core logic**: API endpoints, models, and integrations are built and tested before UI.
- **Frontend in parallel**: UI/UX is developed alongside backend, with early stubs and later real API integration.
- **Security, compliance, and QA**: Security best practices, GDPR/PCI-DSS, and automated/manual QA at every step.
- **Documentation and handoff**: Full code, API, and user documentation delivered at the end.

## 3. Architecture

### Backend
- **Node.js/Express** REST API
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose models
- **JWT** authentication, 2FA (partial)
- **Stripe** for subscriptions/payments
- **Bot engine**: Modular, scalable, supports multiple exchanges (Binance live, others pluggable)
- **Backtesting**: Historical data, strategy simulation
- **Security**: Password hashing, API key encryption, CORS
- **Testing/CI**: Linting, formatting, test stubs

### Frontend
- **React** (with Redux Toolkit for state)
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive UI
- **Auth flows**: Login, register, email verification, password reset
- **Subscription UI**: Plan selection, Stripe checkout, portal, status display
- **Bot UI**: Create/edit bots, strategy config, logs, performance, backtesting with charts
- **Protected routes**: Auth/PrivateRoute wrappers
- **API integration**: Centralized Axios with JWT
